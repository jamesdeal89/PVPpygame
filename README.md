The game is played by two players; using WASD and the arrow keys to move respectively. The control buttons on either side of the keyboard fire a projectile from the player's avatar. Each hit will do 25 damage and players have 100 health. If a player is on 25 health. Their movement speed is reduced to half. There is also an obstacle in the middle of the two players which they and their projectiles cannot cross unless they move around it. The game presents a win-screen for the player left alive when the other reaches 0 health and will quit after a few seconds.
